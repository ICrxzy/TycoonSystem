*Thanks for showing interest in my work!*\
\
This is my first major verse scripting project so dont expect perfection.\
As of the initial snapshot (9/30/25) i have about a week of experience with verse.\
This project is my learning project.\
Expect the scripts to expand and become wider in scope as i add more configurations, and improvements.
